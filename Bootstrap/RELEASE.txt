Hi, I've ported a basic Bootstrap-3 example to Ur/Web and would like to share
the experience. First of all, the example is running on my server here:

    http://46.38.250.132:8081/B2/main

It copies some (but not all) sections of the original 'theme' example [1]. The
Ur/Web sources are located at the Github [2].

Here is my feedback:

1) The Bootstrap as well as other JQuery libraries heavily uses modern HTML5
tags and CSS3-syntax. Some of them are not well supported by the Ur/Web. As a
result, one may need to patch bootstrap files before including them in the
Ur/Web application. For example, bootstrap.css contains the following
declaration

    @font-face {
      font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';
      src: url('../fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot');
    }

The url declared here expects application to be able to serve static files which
normally is not the case in the Ur/Web world. I found it rather difficult to use
thirdparty *css or *js files because of issues like this.

<ad>
For now, I solve this problem by writing a 'project manager' -like tool which compiles
CSS, JavaScript and images into Ur/Web modules (You can see the results by
examinig the top-level project files like [3]).

2) Ur/Web doesn't support aria-* data attributes which is used by bootstrap
internals. I thinkk we should think about adding this support. Probably, the API
should be similar to that of data-* attributes.
Aria is described here http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/

For now, I modified my local copy of the urweb to make it understand the 'role'
attribute of type String.

3) I've tired of rewriting things like  class="btn btn-lg btn-default" into 
class={css (B.btn :: B.btn_lg :: B.btn_default :: [])}. Could we think about
adding a syntaxic sugar to reduce the amount of code? The new sugar may allow
writing classes as usual

    class="class-1 class-2 class-3"

but check them against the declarations

    style class_1
    style class_2
    style class_3


The same thing with data-* attributes: most of the time they are staticly
included in the code, so I would be happy to have pre-processor which may expand
my <p data-target="bla"/> into <p data={data_attr "target" "bla"}/>


4) Lack of aria-* attributes support prevents me from porting some sections of the [1].

5) Using hand-made preprocessing tools like cake3 [4], I've managed to write a self-contained
Ur/Web application which may be built by only 'git clone ... && cd ... && make'.
Don't know why, but this makes me happy :)

Sergey
